Super Mario Land Level Pack

This is a set of 8 Super Mario Land rom hacks. Each features unique levels, graphical updates, and infinite lives.

Most of them are updated to use the graphics from my recent SML DX DMG release. A few of them feature heavy graphic changes. In these cases the only change was to update the Mario and Daisy sprites.

Since asking "Do you want to play 8 new versions of Super Mario Land" is a bit of a heavy statement, here are my recommendations.

Start here:

Super Mario Land Pier Edition

Next try these:

Super Mario Land X

Super Super Mario Land

The 2nd Super Super Mario Land

If you want a challenge try these:

Super Mario Lost Land PLUS

Super Mario Land 2012

If you want to see the limits of SML pushed try these:

Super Mario Land Second Subcon

Super Mario Land Timelines

If you happen to be the author of one of these and don't want it included, just let me know and I'll remove it. I am just hoping to get more folks playing one of my favorite Mario titles.
